# SOLID PRINCIPLES WITH TYPESCRIPT

Content from a live stream from Erick Wendel together with Rodrigo Branas.
Studies purpose only. It's not just for OO.

## TDD

- build software from tests
- every software has 3 parts: given, when, then
- broken, working, refactor
- the test itself will indicate next steps during development

## Archtecture thinking

- starting by domain layer, entities - business logic

## SOLID

1. SRP - Single reponsability principle: separate things that CHANGES FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. It is about moving responsabilities to right places!

2. OCP - Open closed principle: we should be closed for modifications and open for extension.
   - create an abstract class - closing for modifications and opening for extension
